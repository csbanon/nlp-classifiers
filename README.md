Welcome! This folder contains all our code for this course's final project. Here, you can find the following files:

* `ml_imdb.ipynb`: Contains all the classical ML algorthims and analysis plots for the IMDB dataset.
* `ml_sms.ipynb`: Contains all the classical ML algorthims and analysis plots for the SMS Spam dataset.
* `lstm_imdb.py`: Contains the LSTM implementation for the IMDB dataset.
* `lstm_sms.py`: Contains the LSTM implementation for the SMS Spam dataset.

Further, the `data` folder contains both datasets. The internal `data/raw` folder contains the original datasets, while the main folder contains the preprocessed versions.

Thank you!
